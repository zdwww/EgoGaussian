## Updates
- <b>[06/20/2025] Data Correction</b>: The ID in `submission/HOI4D/Video1/id.txt` is incorrect. It should be `ZY20210800001/H1/C8/N11/S321/s03/T2`. Thx to [gaperezsa](https://github.com/gaperezsa) for identifying and reporting this issue.
- <b>[12/01/2024]</b>  Initial code release

## üìù TODO List
- \[x\] Release code of EgoGaussian 
- \[x\] Release 3DGS-ready egocentric data we processed from [EPIC-KITCHENS](https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2024), [HOI4D](https://hoi4d.github.io), and [EPIC Fields](https://epic-kitchens.github.io/epic-fields/). Please also consider citing their great works if you use this subset ü§ó
- \[ \] Upload pre-trained checkpoints for quick evaluation and visualization
- \[ \] EgoGaussian viewer
- \[ \] Pipeline optimization
- \[ \] Tutorial for running EgoGaussian on customized data

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
The setup should be very similar to the original [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) except we used a modified version of [differential gaussian rasterization](https://github.com/ashawkey/diff-gaussian-rasterization/tree/8829d14f814fccdaf840b7b0f3021a616583c0a1) with support of depth & alpha rendering. We will release the `requirements.txt` later.

## Overview

The full EgoGaussian pipelie consists of 4 main stages corresponding to different scripts under `trainers`

1. Static object & background initialization
2. Coarse object pose estimation
3. Fine-tuning object pose & shape
4. Fine-tuning full dynamic scene

## Quick start

You can use the following script to run a full EgoGaussian pipeline from scratch on the provided data.
```shell
sbatch train.sh
```

## Reproducing the results

You can also skip the training and directly reproducing the results of Table 1 in our paper and videos on the webpage by running the following script with the checkpoints we provide.
```shell
DATA_TYPE=EK # or HOI
DATA_NAME=P03_03 # or Video0
RUN_NAME=full
python eval.py \
    --source_path ${DATA_DIR}/${DATA_TYPE}/${DATA_NAME} \
    --out_root ${OUT_DIR} \
    --data_type ${DATA_TYPE} \
    --video ${DATA_NAME} \
    --run_name ${RUN_NAME} \
```

## Acknowledgement
Our implementation is heavily based on the original [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). We thank the authors for their revolutionary work and open-source contributions.
